# Hybrid systems

- Semiconductors are often use in nanoelectronics because their low density of states allows electrostatic control of devices.
- It is possible to induce superconducting correlations in these materials via proximity effect.
- The electric control in hybrid systems allows accessing phenomena that is hard or impossible to access in superconductor-only devices.
