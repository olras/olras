# Minimal models
We begin our discussion by analyzing three simple limiting models that illustrate some of the most interesting features of ABS.

## Weakly couple quantum dot
We consider a pair of single-mode superconducting leads weakly coupled by a normal region.
For the sake of simplicity we neglect spin degrees of freedom.
The Hamiltonian then reads

$$
H = H_{L} + H_{R} + H_\mathrm{dot} + H_\mathrm{tunnel}^L + H_\mathrm{tunnel}^R
$$
where

$$
H_{L/R} = \sum_k \varepsilon_k c_{L/R, k}^\dagger c_{L/R, k} + \Delta \sum_k c_{L/R, k}^\dagger c_{L/R, -k}^\dagger + \mathrm{h.c.}
$$
is the Hamiltonian of the left and right superconducting leads, with $\Delta$ the superconducting order parameter.
The dot hosts a single energy level

$$
H_\mathrm{dot} = \varepsilon_d d^\dagger d.
$$

Finally, the coupling to the leads is parameterized by

$$
H^{L/R}_\mathrm{tunnel} = t_{L/R} \sum_k d^\dagger c_{L/R, k} + \mathrm{h.c.}
$$



Because the superconductors have a bulk gap of $\Delta$, subgap states will be bound to the scattering region and decay exponentially into the superconductors with a length scale set by the coherence length $\xi$.
We look for these states.
